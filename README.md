># Updated to work with Sketch 69

# SMframework could not be opened because the developer could not be verified

**Run this in your terminal:**
`sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Users/${USER}/Library/Application\ Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins/Sketch\ Measure.sketchplugin/Contents/Sketch/SMFramework.framework/SMFramework`

The new version of MacOS is stricter about running software that isn't signed with an Apple developer key. MacOS Catalina is requiring participation in Apple's developer program specifically, and the `SMframework` is currently not built to support that.

`SMframework` is created by @utom and it uses a compiled codebase done in XCode that I don't have access to make changes or make it compatible with Apple's requirement.

# 2.8.1 Fork (2.7.7 SMFramework + 2.8.0 Fixes + 2.7.6 Fixes)

This is a fork I've created some time ago to fix Measure for Sketch v52+.

It includes a lot of changes, fixes and aditions, the latest being the addition of the SMFramework from the v2.7.7 released by @utom recently, allowing for the `Toolbar 2.0` to work to certain extent.

Remember to **uninstall current plugin version**, **restart sketch** then, install the new version.

[Download the latest zip file from the fork](https://github.com/ellunium/sketch-measure-latest/archive/master.zip)

#### Check the version of the installed plugin:

Inside Sketch, Go to the menu:

- Plugins > Manage Plugins...
- Scroll down to "Sketch Measure"
  - It should say 2.8.1

# Changelog:

# A note on Toolbar 2.0 (_beta_)

Some functions won't work as proper with the `Toolbar 2.0` (e.g.: `Text Styles` will not output).
Although I've added the SMFramework from the latest v2.7.7 released by @utom, it uses a compiled codebase done in XCode that I don't have access to make changes.

# Still not working?

Follow the steps below:

- [ ] Uninstall the plugin
- [ ] Quit Sketch
- [ ] Follow the steps bellow to remove the `PluginsWarehouse` folder
- [ ] [Download the latest zip file from the fork](https://github.com/ellunium/sketch-measure-latest/archive/master.zip)
- [ ] Reinstall the plugin
- [ ] Test the `Mark Properties / Spec Export` again

> Remove the `PluginsWarehouse` folder that lives in `~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/`. This is where we cache plugin downloads, and if you’ve been testing different versions of your appcast, you probably have some old stuff there that’s worth cleaning.
>
> - Go to the Finder of Mac OS
> - From the “Go” menu navigate down to “Go to Folder” or...
> - Hit Command+Shift+G from the Mac OS X desktop or a Finder window
> - Paste the folder location `~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/`
> - Remove/Delete the `PluginsWarehouse` folder

I hope it helps :)

# A new feature for Sketch Measure: Export Layer's influence Rect to Spec.

Layer's influence rect includes the area of shadows and outside borders, it's exactly the same size with the exported image.

Regular rect                                                         Influence rect
​

![influence-rect](https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-a639e906f8fea576da8d9a8cc1cc752a_b.png)

Sometime, shadows will not implement by engineers, it should be a part of image. Designer need to show the influence rect to engineers, not the regular rect. This is the feature using for.

Just select the option in Export UI
